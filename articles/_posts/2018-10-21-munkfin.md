## 1. Introduction

What constitutes a good investment advice? First of all, and most importantly, it should bring highest returns. This is its _raison d'Ãªtre_ after all. Provided that, it should also be as simple and intuitive as possible without compromising much in profits. And flowing from this, it should be cheap to manage --- be adjustable without help of paid consultants.

	A good investment advice is simple to grasp, easy to manage, and brings highest returns.

In this article you will learn how multiple generations of economists tried to find the formula for perfect lifetime investment. They had to face competitive pressure from financial consultants, get knocked off course by methodological fads, completely abandon the field for years, before they could return and find the ultimate answer.

## 2. Early days of financial economics

In the first half of the 20th century, _Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association_ (TIAA) provided a _fixed annuity_ pension plan for professors. However post-war economic instabilities made it risky to pay out fixed pensions --- in a possible crisis the revenues could decline significantly, but they still would have to pay promised amounts. Thus, in 1952 _TIAA_ created _College Retirement Equities Fund_ (CREF) which offered _variable annuities_, _i.e._ let people decide on their investment portfolios and link the earnings to the state of economy. So, should markets collapse and earnings decline, CREF would pay out less to investors. If, on the other hand, people would invest successfully, they would earn more money than promised fixed amount.  

Among all the academics whom this news touched directly, there were inevitably many economists as well, and it made them actively think about this investment decision. [_Harry Markowitz_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Markowitz)

The introduction of [_defined contribution_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defined_contribution_plan) pension plan made it possible for individuals to independently manage their retirement savings. However this caused a lot of confusion among people, as they now had to learn how to properly invest their funds, as opposed to a more comfortable [_defined benefit_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defined_benefit_pension_plan) plan, in which they delegated their investment decision to their employers.  

This caused people to seek financial advice from investment consultants, who were usually vague about the models they used, and implied that the only good way to manage finances was to hire them.  

During that time economists reemerged with their old findings by _Markowitz_, _Merton_ and _Samuelson_, which gave closed-form solutions to optimal portfolio allocation problem.

where &alpha; is the share of stocks in the portfolio and _1-&alpha;_ is the share of bonds, _&mu;_ and _R<sub>f</sub>_ are stock and bond rates of return respectively, &sigma; is volatility and &gamma; is a risk-aversion coefficient.  

The above formula was very clear and could be understood by everyone. It also promised _optimal_ returns. Opinion started to spread that financial advisors were not neccessary anymore. However they quickly pointed out that these formulas returned fixed ratios and did not account for age of an investor. They claimed (correctly) that optimal investments could not be fixed throughout the lifetime, and younger people must take more risks to increase the investment returns and older people had to be more conservative.  

This caused economists to rethink their models and incorporate behavioral changes throughout the lifetime. This was when life-cycle investment models were born in economics.

Investment consultants won this round --- after incorporating life-cycle effects all economic models became very complicated and couldn't be solved analytically. People started going back to consultants to manage their savings, as it was easier than trying to learn _dynamic programming_

DARK AGES (no advances whatsoever, only difficult models if any, finance advisers rejoice)
- 1971 Merton added human capital which captured lifecycle effect
- 1978 401(k) was introduced
- 1992
	Peter Bernstein "Capital Ideas" "fins justify their fees by emphasizing tailoring" (interior decorator fallacy)
	Fins have patterns though: young risk more, and asset allocation puzzle - riskier have more stocks and vice versa
	Bodie et al solved Merton for variable wage numerically

NEW WAVE (Revisited by Mankiws, no good models created)
- 1997 Mankiw - asset allocation puzzle
- 1998 Campbell and Viceira - again provide only numerical solution
- 2002 Flavin and Yamashita added housing capital (if preexisting, then more aggressive)
- 2005 Cocco et al added a new heuristic simplifying numerical solution 100 till 40 ; 200-2.5 till 60; 50 after 60


END OF HISTORY
- 2016 Munk reinvented and, man, he nailed it
- 2018 Khodzhimatov provided a simulation
