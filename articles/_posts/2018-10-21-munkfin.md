## 1. Introduction

What constitutes a good investment advice? First of all, and most importantly, it should bring highest returns. This is its _raison d'Ãªtre_ after all. Provided that, it should also be as simple and intuitive as possible without compromising much in profits. And flowing from this, it should be cheap to manage --- be adjustable without help of paid consultants.

In this article you will learn how multiple generations of economists tried to find the formula for perfect lifetime investment. They had to face competitive pressure from financial consultants, get knocked off course by methodological fads, completely abandon the field for years, before they could return and find the ultimate answer.

## 2. Early days of financial economics

In the first half of the 20th century, _Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association_ (TIAA) provided a _fixed annuity_ pension plan for professors. However post-war economic instabilities made it risky to pay out fixed pensions --- in a possible crisis the revenues could decline significantly, but they still would have to pay promised amounts. Thus, in 1952 _TIAA_ created _College Retirement Equities Fund_ (CREF) which offered _variable annuities_, _i.e._ let people decide on their investment portfolios and link the earnings to the state of economy. So, should markets collapse and earnings decline, CREF would pay out less to investors. If, on the other hand, people would invest successfully, they would earn more money than promised fixed amount.

Among all the academics whom this news touched directly, there were inevitably many economists as well, and it made them actively think about this investment decision. [_Harry Markowitz_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Markowitz), then a 25 years old economics graduate student at University of Chicago, chose to split his funds 50-50 between TIAA and CREF. His reasoning was simple --- if stocks would fail, he would have half of his funds paid in safe fixed annuities, and if stocks would perform very well, the other half would bring high returns.

</div>


In hindsight, this was not an optimal choice, however it planted an idea in Markowitz's head that a theory of investments should exist. Not long after, he published his famous paper in _The Journal of Finance_ called simply _Portfolio Selection_, where he used the idea that _people not only want to maximize profits, but also to minimize risks_. This approach came to be known as _"mean-variance analysis"_, where "mean" and "variance" corresponded to returns and risks respectively. In the paper, he provided a graphical argument and didn't use any math. The resulting allocation brought better returns than naive 50-50, but, at the same time, supported the idea that it is better to diversify portfolio than to invest everything in one fund.

</figure>

It is important to notice that the model used 6 assumptions including _risk-averse individuals_ and _efficient markets_. These assumptions would come into question decades later.

As things in academia move slower than anywhere else, the next milestone in portfolio theory was reached only four years later by [_James Tobin_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Tobin), a researcher from the [_Cowles Commission_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowles_Foundation). He claimed that if Markowitz is right, and people care about both returns and risks, then _there is a single optimal ratio of stocks to bonds in the portfolio_. In other words, risk-averse people should hold cash and don't invest much, risk-loving people should even borrow cash to invest, but _neither should change the components of the portfolio_.  

Continuing the theme of slowness in academia, Tobin's paper was published in _The Review of Economic Studies_ in 1958, two years after he wrote it.

This proposition turned out to be very controversial in the industry, as, for years to come, most financial consultants would suggest conservative/old investors to invest more in bonds and aggressive/young investors to invest more in stocks, implying that Tobin is wrong and there is no single optimal portfolio allocation for everyone.  

But _Tobin-Markowitz approach_ (aka _Mean-Variance Analysis_) was so well received in academic circles that no significant improvements were proposed for almost a decade.

## 3. Dark ages

The Sixties passed without any interesting new insights on portfolio theory.  

Meanwhile, the field of macroeconomics was slowly incorporating [_Richard E. Bellman's_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_E._Bellman) [_dynamic programming_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming) methods. By the end of the decade, dynamic programming became so popular in economics that most models were revisited using this brand new toolbox.  

<div class="highlighted">

Thus, it came as no surprise that in 1970 _Journal of Economic Theory_ published [_Robert C. Merton's_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_C._Merton) _dynamic_ formulation of the portfolio allocation problem.  

Merton's paper was complicated, unintuitive and couldn't be solved without a computer. Moreover, it seemingly didn't provide a new information --- the optimal lifetime investment strategy he proposed was to repeat Markowitz's fixed solution forever.  

However it addressed an important issue --- it tackled the problem of _planning future investments in a long horizon_, as opposed to Markowitz's one-period (so-called _"myopic"_) choice. Moreover, it found the same answer with fewer questionable assumptions than Markowitz.

</div>

With the rise in popularity of _401(k)_ plans in late seventies, more and more people started hiring financial consultants to manage their portfolios.  

Perhaps, this was one of the reasons why the consultants didn't like the ideas of Markowitz/Merton --- they justified their fees by emphasizing the need to tailor invesment portfolio to every person individually, of course, they wouldn't want their clients to solve that easy fraction --- this would kill their business.  


[_Peter Bernstein_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_L._Bernstein) called this an _interior decorator fallacy_, where people were told that their portfolio should be uniquely determined, when in reality it didn't have to.
 

However, this is a huge oversimplification. Financial advisers really did have a point, when they were suggesting younger people to risk more than older people --- only economists couldn't formulate this yet.


Eighties also didn't bring any new breakthroughs to the field. The new models either didn't align with real-life investment strategies, or were very complicated and unintuitive, or both. The crisis of ideas was felt acutely.  

Fortunately, in 1990 Harry Markowitz was awarded a Nobel prize in economics for his mean-variance paper. This ignited a new interest in portfolio theory among brightest economists and this ended the dark ages.

## 4. New wave

	Bodie et al solved Merton for variable wage numerically 

nobel to markowitz ; absense of ideas 1990





<div class="highlighted">Life-cycle investment is investment that changes by age EDIT HERE</div>

NEW WAVE (Revisited by Mankiws, no good models created)
- 1997 Mankiw - asset allocation puzzle
- 1998 Campbell and Viceira - again provide only numerical solution
- 2002 Flavin and Yamashita added housing capital (if preexisting, then more aggressive)
- 2005 Cocco et al added a new heuristic simplifying numerical solution 100 till 40 ; 200-2.5 till 60; 50 after 60

## 5. End of history
END OF HISTORY
- 2016 Munk reinvented and, man, he nailed it
- 2018 Khodzhimatov provided a simulation

Investment consultants won this round --- after incorporating life-cycle effects all economic models became very complicated and couldn't be solved analytically. People started going back to consultants to manage their savings, as it was easier than trying to learn _dynamic programming_
