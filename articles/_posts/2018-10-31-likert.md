In my last project I had to find theoretical limits for a _psychometric_ index involving _Likert scale data_ (aka _categorical data_). After successfully finding it, I decided to test the results in a simple _Monte-Carlo simulation_.  

I was surprised to find out that there is no built-in categorical data generator in _R_. What I was looking for, was something like `runif(100)` which would generate a vector of length _100_ where every element is drawn from a _multinomial distribution_ in general or a categorical distribution in particular.  

The first idea was to use `sample` function with given probabilities: `sample(c(0,1,2),1,prob=c(0.33, 0.33, 0.34))` but you couldn't repeat this procedure for _N_ participants without using loops, which is very inefficient, or you would end up with `rep` repeating the same random pick _N_ times.  

I didn't want to use any third-party libraries just for this small application either, so I came up with this simple trick.  

### Algorithm

Suppose, you want to generate a 5-category data _(x1, x2, x3, x4, x5)_ for _N_ participants with probabilities _(1/10, 2/10, 4/10, 2/10, 1/10)_. The following formula will work:

```R
distribution <- c(rep(x1,1),rep(x2,2),rep(x3,4),rep(x4,2),rep(x5,1))
potential <- rep(distribution, M)
likert_data <- sample(potential, N)
```

or, as one-liner:

```R
likert_data <- sample(rep(c(rep(x1,1),rep(x2,2),rep(x3,4),rep(x4,2),rep(x5,1)), M), N)
```

Notice that `distribution` sets the probabilities, `potential` repeats this _M_ times (where _M_ is any number greater than or equal to _N_ --- I personally used _M = N_), and `likert_data` (_uniformly_) randomly picks _N_ elements and returns the required vector.

Notice how in the screenshot above, we obtain almost exact probabilities we wanted: _(1, 2, 4, 2, 1)/10_. Since every time is a random draw, there are some deviations, but repeating this formula and averaging, gives the desired values.  

### Collaborate

Hey, I hope this little hack helped you. As you've learned from the very first paragraph, I am a statistical consultant --- if you are a _researcher_ or _data scientist_ who needs help in developing/tailoring an algorithm, or _if you are a manager_ who wouldn't mind having detailed forecasts for their customer acquisition or future sales, I can help you with that.
