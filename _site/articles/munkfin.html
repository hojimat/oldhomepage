<h2 id="1-introduction">1. Introduction</h2>

<p>What constitutes a good investment advice? First of all, and most importantly, it should bring highest returns. This is its <em>raison d’être</em> after all. Provided that, it should also be as simple and intuitive as possible without compromising much in profits. And flowing from this, it should be cheap to manage — be adjustable without help of paid consultants.</p>

<div class="highlighted">
	A good investment advice is simple to grasp, easy to manage, and brings highest returns.
</div>

<p>In this article you will learn how multiple generations of economists tried to find the formula for perfect lifetime investment. They had to face competitive pressure from financial consultants, get knocked off course by methodological fads, completely abandon the field for years, before they could return and find the ultimate answer.</p>

<p><a name="early"></a><br /></p>
<h2 id="2-early-days-of-financial-economics">2. Early days of financial economics</h2>

<p>In the first half of the 20th century, <em>Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association</em> (TIAA) provided a <em>fixed annuity</em> pension plan for professors. However post-war economic instabilities made it risky to pay out fixed pensions — in a possible crisis the revenues could decline significantly, but they still would have to pay promised amounts. Thus, in 1952 <em>TIAA</em> created <em>College Retirement Equities Fund</em> (CREF) which offered <em>variable annuities</em>, <em>i.e.</em> let people decide on their investment portfolios and link the earnings to the state of economy. So, should markets collapse and earnings decline, CREF would pay out less to investors. If, on the other hand, people would invest successfully, they would earn more money than promised fixed amount.</p>

<p>Among all the academics whom this news touched directly, there were inevitably many economists as well, and it made them actively think about this investment decision. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Markowitz"><em>Harry Markowitz</em></a></p>

<figure class="blog">

<p>Markowitz did 50 50 MVA CAPM TOBIN</p>

<ul>
  <li>1952 Markowitz first paper (fixed ratio)</li>
  <li>1958 Tobin mutual funds (mutual funds)</li>
</ul>

<p>The introduction of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defined_contribution_plan"><em>defined contribution</em></a> pension plan made it possible for individuals to independently manage their retirement savings. However this caused a lot of confusion among people, as they now had to learn how to properly invest their funds, as opposed to a more comfortable <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defined_benefit_pension_plan"><em>defined benefit</em></a> plan, in which they delegated their investment decision to their employers.</p>

<p>This caused people to seek financial advice from investment consultants, who were usually vague about the models they used, and implied that the only good way to manage finances was to hire them.</p>

<p>During that time economists reemerged with their old findings by <em>Markowitz</em>, <em>Merton</em> and <em>Samuelson</em>, which gave closed-form solutions to optimal portfolio allocation problem.</p>

<figure class="blog">
	<img src="/assets/img/munkfin/markowitz.png" alt="naive markowitz" />
	<figcaption>Markowitz's mean-variance formula</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>where α is the share of stocks in the portfolio and <em>1-α</em> is the share of bonds, <em>μ</em> and <em>R<sub>f</sub></em> are stock and bond rates of return respectively, σ is volatility and γ is a risk-aversion coefficient.</p>

<p>The above formula was very clear and could be understood by everyone. It also promised <em>optimal</em> returns. Opinion started to spread that financial advisors were not neccessary anymore. However they quickly pointed out that these formulas returned fixed ratios and did not account for age of an investor. They claimed (correctly) that optimal investments could not be fixed throughout the lifetime, and younger people must take more risks to increase the investment returns and older people had to be more conservative.</p>

<p>This caused economists to rethink their models and incorporate behavioral changes throughout the lifetime. This was when life-cycle investment models were born in economics.</p>

<p>Investment consultants won this round — after incorporating life-cycle effects all economic models became very complicated and couldn’t be solved analytically. People started going back to consultants to manage their savings, as it was easier than trying to learn <em>dynamic programming</em></p>

<p>DARK AGES (no advances whatsoever, only difficult models if any, finance advisers rejoice)</p>
<ul>
  <li>1971 Merton added human capital which captured lifecycle effect</li>
  <li>1978 401(k) was introduced</li>
  <li>1992
  Peter Bernstein “Capital Ideas” “fins justify their fees by emphasizing tailoring” (interior decorator fallacy)
  Fins have patterns though: young risk more, and asset allocation puzzle - riskier have more stocks and vice versa
  Bodie et al solved Merton for variable wage numerically</li>
</ul>

<p>NEW WAVE (Revisited by Mankiws, no good models created)</p>
<ul>
  <li>1997 Mankiw - asset allocation puzzle</li>
  <li>1998 Campbell and Viceira - again provide only numerical solution</li>
  <li>2002 Flavin and Yamashita added housing capital (if preexisting, then more aggressive)</li>
  <li>2005 Cocco et al added a new heuristic simplifying numerical solution 100 till 40 ; 200-2.5 till 60; 50 after 60</li>
</ul>

<p>END OF HISTORY</p>
<ul>
  <li>2016 Munk reinvented and, man, he nailed it</li>
  <li>2018 Khodzhimatov provided a simulation</li>
  <li></li>
