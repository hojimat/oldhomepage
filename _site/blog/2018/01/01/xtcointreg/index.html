  <h1 class="post-title">Introducing Panel FMOLS/DOLS command for Stata</h1>
  <span class="post-date">01 Jan 2018</span>
  <p>Last week I was hired to perform a thorough analysis of a panel dataset for export dynamics of different sectors in a country. I had never done panel econometrics before or even read it in a textbook. But since I am good at cross-section and time-series, I believed I could handle the task. And I wasn’t wrong.</p>

<p>Since this task was single time with no generalizations/automations required, my tool of choice was of course Stata. It doesn’t have a scalability like R but has a very comfortable syntax. You ask me what about E-views? E-views sucks.</p>

<p>However, in process I realized that panel FMOLS cannot be done natively in stata. The closest thing is <code class="highlighter-rouge">xtpedroni</code> but it gives panel DOLS and didn’t add panel FMOLS. R also doesn’t have such a library. Ironically, E-views turned out to have that feature. But I wouldn’t concede that easy. So, I decided to go back to <a href="https://econpapers.repec.org/article/tprrestat/v_3a83_3ay_3a2001_3ai_3a4_3ap_3a727-731.htm">Pedroni’s 1996 paper</a> and examine the structure of panel FMOLS estimators. It turned out to be a simple average between each panel’s FMOLS for coefficients and sum divided by the square root of the total number of panels for t-statistics.</p>

<p>So, I got that and tried to write a code for it, but it turned out to be very challenging. Then I found out that there is actually an existing tool for time series FMOLS estimation called <code class="highlighter-rouge">cointreg</code>. This is an excellent program written by <a href="http://ageconsearch.umn.edu/bitstream/229441/2/sjart_st0272.pdf">Qunyong Wang and Na Wu</a>. So, I just applied the group mean averaging to it.</p>

<p>Meet a new command for Stata <code class="highlighter-rouge">xtcointreg</code>. It basically adapts <code class="highlighter-rouge">cointreg</code> to a panel environment, so you need to <a href="http://agec    onsearch.umn.edu/bitstream/229441/2/sjart_st0272.pdf">install it first</a>. The documentation is the same as <code class="highlighter-rouge">cointreg</code> plus one option <code class="highlighter-rouge">full</code>. I will submit the file to “ssc”. In the meantime you can <a href="/assets/ftp/xtcointreg.ado">download the .ado file here</a> and place it in the folder called “ado” located inside your system directory(which can be found with a command `sysdir’).</p>

<p>Hope it will help you in your research. Please feel free to <a href="/contact">contact me</a> with any questions and commments.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong> It was included to SSC. You can use <code class="highlighter-rouge">ssc install xtcointreg</code> to download it.</p>
