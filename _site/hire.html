<p>I provide data analysis, statistical and economic consulting, academic writing, statistical package tweaking services. I provide tutoring in advanced economics courses.</p>

<h3 id="pricing-policy">Pricing Policy</h3>
<p>I negotiate price for every project individually. I charge relatively affordable fees but my focus is on quality work, not on affordability. 
I make price discrimmination towards tutoring jobs because I am interested in helping people learn - the average tutoring will cost half of the average price. 
I will ask some negotiated percentage upfront before starting the project. Every finished project will include up to 2 free edits, so please include all your edit requests as densely as you can - the rest edits will be charged hourly.</p>

<h3 id="pricing-methods">Pricing Methods</h3>
<p>You can pay me using bank transfer or by contacting me to invoice you a payment on Payoneer service. You don’t have to have a Payoneer account to pay for the invoice - the credit card payment is accepted. Be sure to ignore the commission fees - you can subtract them from the payment. I will repeat this: Don’t pay commissions, I will pay them.</p>

<h3 id="communication-methods">Communication Methods</h3>
<p>I invite clients to the <a href="http://ravshansk.slack.com">Slack chat</a> where we can communicate effectively during the project and retain the contact for future collaboration.</p>

<h3 id="disclaimer">Disclaimer:</h3>
<p>Once you hire me I never publish the work I’ve done - you’ve paid me and it all belongs to you. In the blog of this website I give a generic picture and publish some related stuff, not the work itself.</p>
