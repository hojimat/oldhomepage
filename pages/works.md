		<h3>Caterpillar Inc.</h3>
		<p>As part of my job at <a href="http://devoin.co">Devoin</a> I worked for Borusan Oto to recreate the Caterpillar's database from heavily JS-based online catalogue. I used ingenious scraping/reverse engineering techniques to rebuild this million-data points database.</p>

		<h3>Bosch und Siemens Hausger&auml;te Turkey</h3>
		<p>Customer Service department of BSH had two reporting systems: SMA and QPR. Data from both of them was exported into Excel and manually processed. I built an automation system using VBA (Visual Basic) and made it possible to finish monthly reports in a few minutes.</p>

		<h3>CourseCompare</h3>
		<p>A frozen project. It aims at creating a universal course equivalence database among all the undergraduate colleges in the world. The early prototyping works but the project has continuously been postponed in favor of other more urgent ones. <a href="https://github.com/ravshansk/coursecompare">The collaboration requests are welcome</a>.</p>

		<h3>Stata SSC</h3>
		<p>Stata community has been lacking a panel fully-modified ordinary least squares regression command. I have built it and it is now available as an <a href="https://ideas.repec.org/c/boc/bocode/s458447.html">SSC package here</a>. The package has found its demand and is being heavily used.</p>

		<h3>FA matrix generation</h3>
		<p>I developed an algorithm and corresponding R function that uniformly generates correlation matrices for any n-factor models in factor analysis. This contributed to a psychometric research by a client.</p>

		<h3>Crypto token economics</h3>
		<p>Most of the crypto research has been going in blogs instead of academic journals. This caused most of the incentive structures to be literally verbal. I created a mathematical model of token economies and a prototype R simulation to make future analyses rigorous.</p>
