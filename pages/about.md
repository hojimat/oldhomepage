My name is **Ravshanbek Khodzhimatov**. I am about to graduate from [Master's Program in Economics](http://econ.boun.edu.tr) at [Bogazici University](http://boun.edu.tr), [Istanbul, Turkey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Istanbul). My research interests are _agent-based modeling, macroeconometrics and forecasting_. Aside from my expertise in economics, I have an experience working as _financial analyst, customer service assistant, marketing assistant, interpreter, data scientist and web developer_.  

I am trilingual - my native languages are _Uzbek, Russian and Kyrgyz_. I am fluent in _English and Turkish_. I have a fair fluency in _German_ and elementary in _Arabic_.  

**I am a professional economic consultant. To see my works and to hire me please visit Works and Collaborate tabs.**  

I blog about economics, math, AI and literature. I promise that I won't write anything boring, predictable or pretentious. Some articles will require advanced knowledge of math, but I will try to write accessible ones more frequently. To read my thoughts please visit the Blog tab.  

I am fairly conservative when it comes to Web 2.0 and prefer communication via e-mail, still I included comments section at the end of every post where you can share your thoughts using your Google account (there is a high probability that you have one). At the moment I don't cross-post my articles in other platforms and don't send newsletters, so I encourage you to visit my website from time to time to check for updates.

To contact me please visit the Contact tab where you will find my most up-to-date e-mail and social media links.
