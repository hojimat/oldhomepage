A neighbour of mine is in a wholesale towel business,
different levels of education, different generations, different societies, but we all understand the same thing --- finding clients


it made me think that whoever you are, a freelancer, a businessman, an entreprenur, a writer, an employee, a politician --- you all depend on clients. And the big deal about clients, is that they can look 'dirty' --- some silly complaints, etc. but they are your clients, you sometimes forget their importance. just like steve jobs forced some plugins, just like some politicians see people as slaves etc.

the thing about is mass/macroeconomics is that you usually forget about the underlying units, you focus on 'the big picture'

I remember that at the boarding school we used to have bad meals, and I always thought, why would our manager buy a bad quality food, and then one weekend I went there and saw the supplies --- they were great. It's just when you do a food for four hundred students three times a day, it results in a meh food. the same logic applies to wage/pension increase/decrease --- everybody would think that 20 dollar increase is riddiculous but when thinking about paying 20 more to twenty million people every month forever, it starts to make sense about the magnitude of the budget. so if you steal money and you are a corrupt government worker, then you can buy all those glorious yachts and be a billionaire, leaving the people in the poverty, or even without anyone noticing it.

so we are wrapping it up now --- just think how glamorous the top seems and how ugly does the bottom -- so know, it is an illusion. clients are our all.

clients are risky, they are sometimes annoying, but the startupers and freelancers know their value because they still haven't lost their touch with the ground yet.


so, i know that i touched two different topics here, they are adjacent but different. so, i don't know whether i should separate them or not, yet. i have to figure it out and publish.As an economic and statistical consultant I noticed that academics don't want to hire consultants for data analytics or predictive analytics or any other task
