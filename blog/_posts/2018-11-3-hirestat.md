## what's wrong with data science
### When I was a kid, it was called statistics
- just buzzwords
- df
your data is never big, if it is, don't read this post
overhyped
### No theory
- many have only taken one course
- many can't develop algorithms - my clients are data scientists
- actually, there is no theory - models are atheoretical
### Statisticians can do it
- everybody non-dumb can apply theory to real world
ENough of criticism. Now, what can stats propose you?

## why statisticians are better
- rememeber black scholes being misused as a black box
