title: Crypto-token economy. Discussion, model and R implementation

Last fall I was hired to build an economic model for _token-curated registries_ as part of my [consulting job](/#hire). Since then, I encountered many people who expressed interest in this model, so I decided to share the basic theory and implementation.

## 1. Philosophical discussion

The great expositive summary of _Token economy_ can be found in Wikipedia, so I am assuming you know what it is. As I see it, token economy is an attempt to quantify life and give a price to everything. This aligns perfectly with classical economic thinking, where even externalities, such as air pollution, can be compensated by a sufficient tax.  

Wikipedia says that it has been used successfully in schools and psychiatric hospitals, but the recent resurgence in interest has begun with the cryptocurrency rush. Since the creation of universally accepted token was problematic before, nobody tried to tie all services to some price. However, the open source blockchain algorithms made this process really easy and suddenly many people decided that it is a good idea to make tokens of everything. 
 
    
Being an economist myself, I think this terribly wrong. I understand where this thinking comes from --- everybody has taken _Econ 101_. But I also know that _free market_ is not the one and only mechanism out there. _Matching mechanisms_, _social planner's problem_, _lotteries_ all exist for a reason. Sadly, not everybody takes advanced econ courses and almost everybody wants to profit from _ICO_'s.  

Despite the above paragraphs, I believe using tokens can be justified in appropriate cases. Actually, the great working area for tokens is online games, where every crystal is given a price and has an obvious value to players. Basically, whenever a labor is involved, any money making is good. Otherwise, it is some kind of _rent seeking_. Moreover, it doesn't really matter what I think, as long as there is a demand for modelling token economies, I will keep on doing this job, since it pays.  

Next section will define all actors in a _crypto-token economy_, and the following ones will analyze their static and dynamic interactions.

## 2. Agents and motivations

In a standard modern _crypto-token economy_ there are three types of agents:

- **experts** --- people who actually do the job and create value. They are incentivized by a system to do the best job they can to earn more tokens.  

_The more experts a system has, the greater is the value for customers._
- **users** --- people who use and benefit from the service created by the _experts_ and pay for it using bought tokens.  

_The more users a system has, the higher is the demand for (and, therefore, the exchange rate of) tokens._
- **investors** --- people who buy tokens for _ICO_ value and hold them in expectation of future profits.  

_The more investors a system has, the more is actual value of tokens and the more cash is in hands of system owners._
